- 👋 Hi, I’m @theLostKeys
- 👀 I’m a master of coding, I can code by thought, I don't use traditional languages. Occasionally, I code even without thought, using the medium we all were born with, beer.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my developing, at a pace that outpaces some current pacers. Only time will tell, who is the fastest at developing development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find like-minded and like-looking abnormal people to assist in my goal to guide a group to code without actually coding, without looking like we are coding.
- 📫 You cannot find me, sorry, I am obschronic and dillapidary. My whereabouts are shallow and pedantic.
